\section{Assignment Two: Denoising of Signals} % (fold)
\label{sec:assignment_two_denoising_of_signals}

In this section we show the ability of the Fast Fourier Transform to filter signals in order to remove unwanted noise. Such denoising may be performed in multiple manners: high pass filtering, low pass filtering, and amplitude filtering.
